# Kibana log slicer with Vue.js

https://vuejs.org[Vue.js] application to quickly drill down into https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana], for applications deployed to Kubernetes.

As the look and feel of the application already shows: This is an application built by developers for developers. :)

== Background

We run a suite of applications in Kubernetes, which are promoted from one namespace to another as development proceeds.
Our application logs are formatted to logstash's JSON format with https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder[Logstash Logback Encoder] and captured by https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[Filebeat].
This ensures application logs for all deployments are immediately available in Kibana, with filterable fields attributes.

== Configuration

Input consists of `src/namespaces.json`, which lists the Kubernetes namespaces along with their corresponding Kibana instance details.
Running `./dist/kubectl-namespace-apps.sh src/namespaces.json src/` yields `apps-<namespace>.txt` files with the applications deployed per namespace.
All files in `src/` can then be deployed together anywhere.
